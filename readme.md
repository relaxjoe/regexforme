# Regex Tutorial: Understanding Email Validation

This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of a specific regular expression (regex) used for email validation. By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to understand and explain the function of each component of this regex.

## Regex Featured: `/^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/`

This regex is commonly used to validate email addresses in various applications. It checks if the input string is in the format of a standard email address.

- [End of Line](#end-of-line)

### Start of Line

The `^` symbol represents the start of the line. This means that the regex match must start at the beginning of the line.

### User Name

`[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+` matches one or more (+) of the characters inside the square brackets ([]). These characters can be lowercase (a-z), uppercase (A-Z), numeric (0-9), or special characters (._%+-). This part of the regex is used to match the user name part of an email address.

### At Symbol

The `@` symbol is a required character in an email address. This part of the regex matches the @ symbol.

### Domain Name

`[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+` matches one or more (+) of the characters inside the square brackets ([]). These characters can be lowercase (a-z), uppercase (A-Z), numeric (0-9), or special characters (. and -). This part of the regex is used to match the domain name part of an email address.

### Dot Separator

`\.` matches the period (.) character. The backslash (\) is used to escape the period, which is a special character in regex. This part of the regex is used to match the dot that separates the domain name and the domain extension in an email address.

### Domain Extension

`[a-zA-Z]{2,}` matches two or more ({2,}) of the characters inside the square brackets ([]). These characters can be lowercase (a-z) or uppercase (A-Z). This part of the regex is used to match the domain extension (like .com, .net, etc.) of an email address.

### End of Line

The `$` symbol represents the end of a line. This means that the regex match must end at the end of the line. This ensures that the entire input must match the regex pattern; it can't be part of a larger string.
